            "THEGREENLAND" is a fairly new Chenaurus Map server (about 1 year old now) and is fast gaining attention from the "DAYZ" PS4/PS5 community.
<br>
<br>
            Our 36 slot server can be played by anyone from the "casual" once a week player
<br>
            to the "hardcore" everyday gamer.
<br>
<br>
            "THEGREENLAND" covers most aspects of gameplay for users who like to go on murderous rampages
<br>
            on the coast or even for users who like to be seen as survivalist enthusiasts living alone in the woods.

            Thats right every new member who joins our server gets <b><i>free gear</i></b>. If you make it to the trader 
            <br>
            you get one free loot of the shop, that means you can take whatever you need to get yourself geared ready for
