            Here on <q><b>THEGREENLAND</b></q> we like to keep the server fun and active thats why we have added a number

        <h2 class="margin">Air Drops</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="quotes , textfont , margin">
            This event has to be number one on the list as it will provide you with hard to come by loot and a pvp challenge.
<br>
            As we are running this server on console we dont have the machanics to do anything to visual, so these airdrops can be seen on the players screen as red smoke coming out of a sea chest.
<br>
            The loot contained within these chests is selected by random and will usually contain a gun, grenades or landmines ammo, food, medical equipment and clothing.
<br>
            As mentioned above to get the most out of this event join our discord for more information on times and locations.
